Hey!

I code things at times.  I [share](https://jace.pro) thoughts on those things.  I try to keep on top of the [ServiceNow News](https://news.jace.pro).  I'm always trying to learn things to improve my work.  Lately I've been doing that with [RedwoodJS](https://redwoodjs.com) to learn React, and GraphQL.  

That being said, I started a project called [Tskr](https://tskr.io).  It's out there in the open and I'd love to help you help me.  Really though I just want some place to start for a number of projects I have in my hopper.
